# Zitux - A Tribute to Our Legacy

Welcome to the Zitux repository! This project serves as a commemoration of Zitux, the company founded by **Sebastián Iturralde** and **Daniel Vaca** in 2009. Zitux started as a web design company and, during its time, accomplished many creative and technical milestones, with Daniel as the lead front-end developer.

## About Zitux

In the late 2000s, Zitux was at the forefront of web design, creating cutting-edge websites that pushed the boundaries of what was possible at the time. Daniel’s innovative templates and our collaborative designs were ahead of their era, demonstrating our dedication to providing clients with high-quality and unique digital experiences.

Although Zitux no longer provides front-end development services, the essence of the company remains in this repository as a reminder of our efforts, achievements, and the passion we poured into our work.

## Purpose of This Repository

This GitHub repository is a tribute to what Zitux once was—a company fueled by creativity, innovation, and the pursuit of excellence in web design. Here, we’ve created a commemorative webpage, which serves as a digital monument to Zitux’s legacy. 

The site celebrates our past successes, honors the hard work that went into each project, and stands as a testament to the time when Zitux thrived in the web development industry. While the company has faded from its active role, the memory of what we built together lives on.

This repository may hold special meaning for anyone who was part of that journey. It stands as a nostalgic nod to the days we spent coding, designing, and creating during our front-end development careers.

## Zitux's Legacy

While Zitux no longer operates, its legacy endures. This repository is dedicated to preserving that history, so it may serve as a reminder to all who were part of Zitux’s journey. It’s a place where past meets present, allowing us to look back on those early days of web development with pride and nostalgia.
